        <marquee>Design by : Kaaffah </marquee>
        <p> You and I (don't let go) were alive (don't let go)
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait (don't let go) and pretend (don't let go)
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten
About you? </p>
